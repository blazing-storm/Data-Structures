/***
 * You have been given two arrays, 'AT' and 'DT', representing the arrival and departure times of all trains that reach a railway station.
 * Your task is to find the minimum number of platforms required for the railway station so that no train needs to wait.
 * Note :
    1. Every train will depart on the same day and the departure time will always be greater than the arrival time. For example, A train with arrival time 2240 and departure time 1930 is not possible.

    2. Time will be given in 24H format and colons will be omitted for convenience. For example, 9:05AM will be given as "905", or 9:10PM will be given as "2110".

    3. Also, there will be no leading zeroes in the given times. For example, 12:10AM will be given as “10” and not as “0010”.
    
 * Try to solve the problem in O(N) time and O(1) space.
